## *About me*

*A few months ago I discovered the world of programming. Unfortunately I haven't experience in this field. But I belive that an intrest in new and unknown things together with hard work will help me to master a new profession. For about 10 years I have been working asa process engineer and have successesfully controled the processes that depand on me. I can work in a team and take responsibility for my work. My goal is to become a good front-end developer. And I will definitely achieve it!*
